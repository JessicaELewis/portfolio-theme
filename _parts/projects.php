            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™ve been focusing on WordPress Development for the past 5 years and have used various strategies for theme building. I enjoy writing clean code and often extrapolate frequently-used snippets into functions that can be used more globally. My workflow tends to change a little at a time between each project as I think of better ways to organize my code or want to try a new approach in running through a project timeline. Because of this drive to improve both my code and my time management, I have the flexibility to work with a wide variety of teams and workflows.</p>
